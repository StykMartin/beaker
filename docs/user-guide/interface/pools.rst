System pools
============

Systems can be grouped together into system pools. Any Beaker user can
create a system pool. The pool owner can either be a user ("owning
user", set by default to the creating user) or modified to be owned by a user
group ("owning group"). A system can belong to multiple pools.

Viewing pools
-------------

To view a list of all pools, select :menuselection:`Systems --> Pools` from
the menu. To only list pools owned by you, select :menuselection:`Hello --> My System Pools`. 


Creating a new pool
-------------------

To create a new pool, select :menuselection:`Systems --> Pools` from
the menu and then click the :guilabel:`+Create` link at the bottom left. You'll then be 
prompted to enter a "Pool Name" and upon clicking  :guilabel:`Create`,
you will be taken to the pool's page.

Editing a pool
--------------

Only a pool owner ("owning user" or "owning group") can edit a system
pool.

To edit a pool, select :menuselection:`Hello --> My System Pools` and click on the 
name of the pool you wish to edit. From the pool's page, you can add
or edit the pool description, change the owner, add and remove systems
and update the :term:`pool access policy`.

You can also delete a pool from the pool's page.

Pool activity
--------------

To search through the historical activity of all pools, select 
:menuselection:`Activity --> System Pools` from the menu.
