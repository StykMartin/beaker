Groups
======

Users can be grouped together in groups. Any Beaker user can create a group and 
add users to it, while Beaker administrators can also define groups that are 
populated automatically from an LDAP directory.

Viewing groups
--------------

To view a list of all groups of which you are a member, select 
:menuselection:`Hello --> My Groups` from the menu.

Adding a group
--------------

To add a new group, select :menuselection:`Hello --> My Groups` from the menu and 
then click the :guilabel:`Add ( + )` link at the bottom left. You'll then be 
prompted to enter a "Display Name" and a "Group Name". The former is the name 
that users of Beaker will see, and the latter is the name used internally. It's 
fine to have these names the same, or different.

Editing a group
---------------

To edit a group, select :menuselection:`Hello --> My Groups` and click on the 
name of the group you wish to edit. From here you can add users as 
well as changing the group's display name and group name.

Group activity
--------------

To search through the historical activity of all groups, select 
:menuselection:`Activity --> Groups` from the menu.
