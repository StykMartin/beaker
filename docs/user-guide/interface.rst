Beaker interface
================

The Beaker web interface provides convenient access to monitor, configure
and control systems, jobs and other components of a Beaker installation.

.. note::

   The Beaker web interface requires a reasonably modern browser that can
   appropriately handle Javascript and CSS styling. The use of Firefox 10
   or later (including Firefox ESR 10) is recommended, but the interface
   should work reliably with any modern standards compliant browser.
