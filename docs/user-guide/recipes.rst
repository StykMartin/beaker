Recipes
-------

Recipes are contained within a Job (although indirectly, as directly
they are contained in a recipe set) and are themselves a container for
Tasks. There can be more than one Recipe per Job. The purpose of a
Recipe is to group a set of Tasks into a single logical unit (See:
:ref:`job-workflow-details`).

Recipe searching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Recipe search is accessed through the "Scheduler" at the top of the
page, and clicking on the "Recipe" menu item.
