What's New in Beaker 0.9?
=========================

As of version 0.9, Beaker no longer relies on Cobbler for provisioning systems. 
A new lab controller daemon, :program:`beaker-provision`, executes power 
commands and manages the TFTP root. Kickstarts are generated by and served from 
the Beaker server.

Within Beaker itself, compatibility has been maintained and the change should 
be largely invisible. In particular, kickstart metadata for systems and recipes 
will behave the same as in previous releases.

However, if your site is using any Cobbler functionality directly you may need 
to take steps to migrate the configuration to Beaker. See 
:ref:`cobbler-migration`.

in the 0.9.x release series.
